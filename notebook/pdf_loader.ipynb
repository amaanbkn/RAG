This interference can change the shape of the signal. \\n1. Single-Bit Error \\nThe term single-bit error means that only 1 bit of a given data unit (such as a byte, character, or \\npacket) is changed from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2. Burst Error \\nThe term burst error means that 2 or more bits in the data unit have changed from 1 to 0 or from 0 \\nto 1. \\nRedundancy \\n➔ The central concept in detecting or correcting errors is redundancy. \\n➔ Some extra bits (redundant bits) are added with data to detect and correct errors.  \\n➔ These redundant bits are added by the sender and removed by the receiver.  \\n \\nDetection versus Correction \\n➔ The correction of errors is more difficult than the detection.'),\n",

Coding schemes can be divided into two \\nbroad categories: block coding and convolution coding.  \\nBLOCK CODING \\n➔ In block coding, message is divided into blocks, each of k bits, called datawords.  \\n➔ Add r redundant bits to each block to make the length n = k + r. The resulting n-bit blocks \\nare called codewords. \\n➔ With k bits, 2kdatawords can be created; with n bits, 2n codewords can be created. \\n➔  Since n >k, the number of possible codewords is larger than the number of possible \\ndatawords. \\nError Detection \\nIf the following two conditions are met, the receiver can detect a change in the original codeword. \\n1. The receiver has (or can find) a list of valid codewords. \\n2. The original codeword has changed to an invalid one. \\n \\n \\nHamming Distance \\n➔ The Hamming distance between two words (of the same size) is the number of \\ndifferences between the corresponding bits.'),\n",

Cyclic codes have a very good performance in detecting single-biterrors, double errors, \\nan odd number of errors, and burst errors. \\n2.  They can easily be implemented in hardware and software. They are especially fast when \\nimplemented in hardware. \\nCHECKSUM \\nChecksum is an error-detecting technique that can be applied to a message of any length. In the \\nInternet, the checksum technique is mostly used at the network and transport layer rather than the \\ndata-link layer. \\nAt the source, the message is first divided into m-bit units. The generator then creates an extra m-\\nbit unit called the checksum, which is sent with the message. At the  destination, the checker \\ncreates a new checksum from the combination of the message  and sent checksum. If the new \\nchecksum is all 0s, the message is accepted; otherwise, the message is discarded.'),\n",

Otherwise, there is an error somewhere and the data are not accepted. \\n➔ We can make the job of the receiver easier if we send the negative (complement) of the \\nsum, called the checksum. \\n➔  In this case, we send (7, 11, 12,0,6, -36). The receiver can add all the numbers received \\n(including the checksum). If the result is 0, it assumes no error; otherwise, there is an \\nerror. \\nOne's Complement \\n➔ The previous example has one major drawback. All of our data can be written as a 4-bit \\nword (they are less than 15) except for the checksum. \\n➔  One solution is to use one's complement arithmetic. \\n➔  If the number has more than n bits, the extra leftmost bits need to be added to the n \\nrightmost bits (wrapping).  \\n➔ In one's complement arithmetic, a negative number can be represented by inverting all \\nbits (changing a 0 to a 1 and a 1 to a 0).\"),\n",

Polling \\n➔ Polling works with topologies in which one device is designated as a primary \\nstation and the other devices are secondary stations.  \\n➔ The primary device controls the link; t he secondary devices follow its \\ninstructions.  \\n➔ The primary device, therefore, is always the initiator of a session \\n➔ If the primary wants to receive data, it asks the secondary’s if they have anything \\ntosend; this is called poll function. Secondary responds with DATA if any ,else \\nnegative ack (NAK) if it has nothing to send.'),\n",

Coding schemes can be divided into two \\nbroad categories: block coding and convolution coding.  \\nBLOCK CODING \\n➔ In block coding, message is divided into blocks, each of k bits, called datawords.  \\n➔ Add r redundant bits to each block to make the length n = k + r. The resulting n-bit blocks \\nare called codewords. \\n➔ With k bits, 2kdatawords can be created; with n bits, 2n codewords can be created. \\n➔  Since n >k, the number of possible codewords is larger than the number of possible \\ndatawords. \\nError Detection',\n",
