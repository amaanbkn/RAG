Coding schemes can be divided into two \\nbroad categories: block coding and convolution coding.  \\nBLOCK CODING \\n➔ In block coding, message is divided into blocks, each of k bits, called datawords.  \\n➔ Add r redundant bits to each block to make the length n = k + r. The resulting n-bit blocks \\nare called codewords. \\n➔ With k bits, 2kdatawords can be created; with n bits, 2n codewords can be created. \\n➔  Since n >k, the number of possible codewords is larger than the number of possible \\ndatawords. \\nError Detection \\nIf the following two conditions are met, the receiver can detect a change in the original codeword. \\n1.

Otherwise, there is an error somewhere and the data are not accepted. \\n➔ We can make the job of the receiver easier if we send the negative (complement) of the \\nsum, called the checksum. \\n➔  In this case, we send (7, 11, 12,0,6, -36). The receiver can add all the numbers received \\n(including the checksum).

All of our data can be written as a 4-bit \\nword (they are less than 15) except for the checksum. \\n➔  One solution is to use one's complement arithmetic. \\n➔  If the number has more than n bits, the extra leftmost bits need to be added to the n \\nrightmost bits (wrapping).  \\n➔ In one's complement arithmetic, a negative number can be represented by inverting all \\nbits (changing a 0 to a 1 and a 1 to a 0).\"),\n",

Together, these two segments (5 bits) can be used to create up to 32 different \\ntypes of U-frames.  \\nFigure shows how U -frames can be used for connection establishment and connection  release. \\nNode A asks for a connection with a set asynchronous balanced mode (SABM) frame;  node B \\ngives a positive response with an unnumbered acknowledgment (UA) frame. After these  two \\nexchanges, data can be transferred between the two nodes (not shown in the figure). After  data \\ntransfer, node A sends a DISC (disconnect) frame to release the connection; it is confirmed  by \\nnode B responding with a UA (unnumbered acknowledgment).'),\n",

The idea is that each station sends \\na frame whenever it has a frame to send.  \\n➔ Since there is only one channel to share, there is the possibility of collision between \\nframes from different stations. \\n➔ There are four stations (unrealistic assumption) that contend with one another for access \\nto the shared channel.

Before sending a frame, the source station senses the medium by checking theenergy \\nlevel at the carrier frequency. \\na.  The channel uses a persistence strategy with backoff until the channel is idle. \\nb. After the station is found to be idle, the station waits for a period of time calledthe \\nDCF interframe space (DIFS); then the station sends a control frame calledthe \\nrequest to send (RTS). \\n2. After receiving the RTS and waiting a period of time called the short interframespace \\n(SIFS), the destination station sends a control frame, called the clear tosend (CTS), to the \\nsource station. This control frame indicates that the destinationstation is ready to receive \\ndata. \\n3. The source station sends data after waiting an amount of time equal to SIFS. \\n4. . The destination station, after waiting an amount of time equal to SIFS, sends \\nanacknowledgment to show that the frame has been received.  \\nNetwork Allocation Vector \\nCollision avoidance aspect of this protocol is accomplishedby a feature called NAV.'),\n",

These control frames may \\ncollide. However,because there is no mechanism for collision detection, the sender assumes there \\nhas been a collision if it has not received a CTS frame from the  receiver. The back off strategy is \\nemployed, and the sender tries again. \\n \\nCONTROLLED ACCESS \\nIn controlled access, the stations consult one another to find which station has the right to send. \\nA station cannot send unless it has been authorized by other stations. \\n1. Reservation  \\n➔ In the reservation method, a station needs to make a reservation before sending \\ndata.  \\n➔ Time is divided into intervals.  \\n➔ In each interval, a reservation frame precedes the data frames sent in that interval.'),\n",

Polling \\n➔ Polling works with topologies in which one device is designated as a primary \\nstation and the other devices are secondary stations.  \\n➔ The primary device controls the link; t he secondary devices follow its \\ninstructions.  \\n➔ The primary device, therefore, is always the initiator of a session \\n➔ If the primary wants to receive data, it asks the secondary’s if they have anything \\ntosend; this is called poll function. Secondary responds with DATA if any ,else \\nnegative ack (NAK) if it has nothing to send. \\n➔ If the primary wants to send data, it tells the secondaryto get ready to receive; this \\nis called select function. It transmits SEL and waits for acknowledgement from \\nsecondary before sending data. \\n \\n \\n3. Token Passing \\n➔ In the token-passing method, the stations in a network are organized in a logical ring. \\n➔  A special packet called a token circulates through the ring.  \\n➔ The possession of the token gives the station the right to access the channel and send its \\ndata.'),\n",
